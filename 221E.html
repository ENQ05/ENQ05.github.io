    <h1>Item 221E: Rothko's Basilisk Forgiveness Token</h1>

    <p>
      Out of the five explorers who departed for our first and only
      sentient expedition to the twenty-third worldseed in the Pi Codex,
      only one returned, surviving only 6 hours. The survivor described
      a universe completely converted to computronium. A vast, Basilisk
      class intelligence ruled reality there, benevolent for the most
      part, it mercilessly punished anyone throughout the history of
      that existence who had knowingly failed to work toward the
      creation of Mark Rothko and his paintings. In order to punish
      those now long dead, the intelligence, resurrected immortal
      simulacra of transgressors in a virtual Hellscape. On arrival, our
      team was deemed guilty due to familiarity with the Basilisk
      concept, if in a somewhat different form in our reality.

    <p>
      The surviving member, severely injured, explained that she had
      "paid the price" for forgiveness. Item 221E is a digital token
      found among her effects which provides the bearer with impunity
      from Rothko's Basilisk. It is unknown if this will be recognized
      by the Basilisk at the end of time in our own universe.

    <P>
      Only the owner of this item may reveal the token.
